30 day Project
30 day Project program
So what is this?

This is a 30 day project with the whole purpose is self improvement and the goal is to just be better than when u started. You come up with a small tractable 1 month plan where you´re gonna have some concrete output that you´re working towards. So on the first day we all start our small projects together as a fun social experience, and also to extend support and accountability for each other.

As gamers have a hard time starting tasks i´d say this is the perfect platform for this.


My needs from you for this to work:

 a channel, a mod for the first month, and then if it works out mod power for that channel so i can supervise it without it being any more straining on ya´ll :peepoheart:

What this requires to work:

Simple, all it really needs is people to be willing to do it. It needs a community that wants to better themselves.

What will this bring to the server:

Honestly i think this might be a great motivator to start taking action against your video game “addiction”. There is no lose in this project, if u did 1 day, 1 try of whatever u set out to do, u already succeeded here. 

and a lot of people seems to have a hard time following a schedule or planning their path. So i will give people advice and provide them with templates, formulas. give tips and tricks on how to really simplify this process of keeping track of and making a good project plan.

Being able to plan something, then going back to look at it and analyze it really helps you see your progress and validate it. as well as appreciate that you´re now farther along then when u started, which is what really matters.

How does it work?

So lets say u have this thing you want to do. Beginning to work out for example. You want to be CONCRETE about what it is that you´re doing. Focus on the INPUTS (what you can control) rather than the OUTPUTS (what it generates). You want some modest goals and don´t worry about falling behind or your plan falling apart. So what you want is your project idea, the goal output, time commitment and milestones for the 4 weeks to come. So to get this i will provide these points:

●	Break down your project into as many small, actionable steps as possible and write out when you´ll work on each.
●	Focus on the process (inputs) over the end product (outputs)! For example “Go to the gym 3x/week and stop drinking soda” over “Lose 5lbs”.
●	Avoid goals which are out of your direct control. For example use “Write a 10,000 word short story” instead of “Win an award for my story”.

So for a lot of people that do this, things will not go as planned. Life happens. Some projects might take longer time than 30 days, some projects gets hindered and have to start late or take a pause or even just stop. Some might finish faster than 30 days. all great, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that ur farther along then when u started. That´s it.
